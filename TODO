01:22:50        xdave | I'm going to create a env section in the code
01:23:03        xdave | it will store all config vars and help you get env vars
01:23:09        xdave | and two functions
01:23:18        xdave | env_get()
01:23:20        xdave | env_set()
01:23:58        xdave | it'll be a reusable struct, so you can use it in
			multiple contexts for templates too
01:24:09      xtraeme | good idea
