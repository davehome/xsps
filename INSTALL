BASIC:

	To build and install/uninstall xsps, follow these steps:

	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	To uninstall:

	$ sudo make uninstall

	(By default, everything is installed in /usr/local)

	Done!

ADVANCED:

	You may change some options about the build and install.  Please see
	the Makefile for available options; once you know what you want, use
	them like so:

	For example:

	$ make CXX=clang++ STATIC=-static STD=-std=c++11
	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr install

	The xsps executable is copied to the bin/ directory of the PREFIX under
	the chosen DESTDIR.  The default DESTDIR is blank (defaults to /).

	NOTE: The same command used to install xsps must be used to uninstall
	it (while using the included Makefile); for example:

	If you installed xsps with:

	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr install

	You must uninstall it with:

	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr uninstall

	Just change the word 'install' to 'uninstall'.
