BASIC:

	To build and install/uninstall xsps, follow these steps:

	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	To uninstall:

	$ sudo make uninstall

	* By default, everything is installed in $HOME/xsps_install/usr/local

	* The global configuration file is installed into:
		$HOME/xsps_install/etc/xsps

	Done!

ADVANCED:

	You may change some options about the build and install.  Please see
	the Makefile for available options; once you know what you want, use
	them like so:

	For example:

	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr CCACHE=ccache -j10
	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr install

	(Note, you must specify the DESTDIR and PREFIX while only buliding, too)

	The xsps executables is copied to the bin/ directory of the PREFIX under
	the chosen DESTDIR.  The default DESTDIR is blank (defaults to /).

	NOTE: The same command used to install xsps must be used to uninstall
	it (while using the included Makefile); for example:

	If you installed xsps with:

	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr install

	You must uninstall it with:

	$ make DESTDIR=~/somewhere PREFIX=/usr uninstall

	Just change the word 'install' to 'uninstall'.
